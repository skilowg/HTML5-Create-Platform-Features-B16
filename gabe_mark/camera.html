                <h1>The Legend Lives</h1>
                <p>Timberlake began work on his third studio album The 20/20 Experience in June 2012, with "no rules and/or end goal in mind". He publicly announced his return to the music industry in January 2013, releasing the album's lead single "Suit & Tie" featuring Jay-Z later that month. After four years not performing in concert, Timberlake appeared the night before the 2013 Super Bowl and performed during the "DirecTV Super Saturday Night", on February 2 in New Orleans.On February 10, he performed "Suit & Tie" with sepia-toned lighting at the 55th Grammy Awards, with Jay-Z joining him from the audience. The 20/20 Experience was released on March 19 through RCA Records due to the disbandment of Jive Records. The album debuted at number one on the charts by moving just over 980,000 copies. </p>
